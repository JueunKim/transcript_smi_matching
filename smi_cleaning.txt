<p class=KRCC>The One Where It All Began
<sync start=6206>&nbsp;
<sync start=7492>
<p class=KRCC>English Subtitles by GELULA & CO., INC.
<sync start=8481>&nbsp;
<sync start=54012>
<p class=KRCC>There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with.
<sync start=57641>&nbsp;
<sync start=57892>
<p class=KRCC>You're going out with a guy.
<sync start=59962>&nbsp;
<sync start=60212>
<p class=KRCC>There's gotta be something wrong with him.
<sync start=62521>&nbsp;
<sync start=62812>
<p class=KRCC>All right, Joey, be nice.
<sync start=64723>&nbsp;
<sync start=64972>
<p class=KRCC>So does he have a hump and a hair piece?
<sync start=67532>&nbsp;
<sync start=69092>
<p class=KRCC>Wait. Does he eat chalk?
<sync start=70366>&nbsp;
<sync start=71572>
<p class=KRCC>I don't want her to go through what I did with Carl.
<sync start=74644>&nbsp;
<sync start=74892>
<p class=KRCC>Okay, everybody relax.
<sync start=76405>&nbsp;
<sync start=76652>
<p class=KRCC>Relax. This is not even a date.
<sync start=78449>&nbsp;
<sync start=78692>
<p class=KRCC>It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.
<sync start=82480>&nbsp;
<sync start=83492>
<p class=KRCC>Sounds like a date to me.
<sync start=84971>&nbsp;
<sync start=87812>
<p class=KRCC>I'm in high school, in the middle of the cafeteria. . .
<sync start=90451>&nbsp;
<sync start=90692>
<p class=KRCC>. . .and I realize I'm totally naked.
<sync start=93684>&nbsp;
<sync start=94132>
<p class=KRCC>I've had that dream.
<sync start=95850>&nbsp;
<sync start=96092>
<p class=KRCC>Then I look down and I realize there is a phone. . .
<sync start=99721>&nbsp;
<sync start=100692>
<p class=KRCC>. . .there.
<sync start=102125>&nbsp;
<sync start=104412>
<p class=KRCC>-Instead of-- 
<sync start=106004>&nbsp;
<sync start=104412>
<p class=KRCC>That's right!
<sync start=106004>&nbsp;
<sync start=106492>
<p class=KRCC>That one, I've never had.
<sync start=107811>&nbsp;
<sync start=108052>
<p class=KRCC>All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
<sync start=112204>&nbsp;
<sync start=112412>
<p class=KRCC>I don't know what to do. Everybody's looking at me.
<sync start=115290>&nbsp;
<sync start=115532>
<p class=KRCC>They weren't looking at you before?
<sync start=117363>&nbsp;
<sync start=118892>
<p class=KRCC>Finally, I figure I'd better answer it.
<sync start=121725>&nbsp;
<sync start=122772>
<p class=KRCC>And it turns out it's my mother.
<sync start=125332>&nbsp;
<sync start=126572>
<p class=KRCC>Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.
<sync start=130326>&nbsp;
<sync start=139812>
<p class=KRCC>This guy says, ''Hello,'' I wanna kill myself.
<sync start=142531>&nbsp;
<sync start=143292>
<p class=KRCC>You okay, sweetie?
<sync start=144281>&nbsp;
<sync start=145332>
<p class=KRCC>I feel like someone grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth. . .
<sync start=149803>&nbsp;
<sync start=150052>
<p class=KRCC>-. . .and tied it around my neck. 
<sync start=152725>&nbsp;
<sync start=150052>
<p class=KRCC>Cookie?
<sync start=152725>&nbsp;
<sync start=154772>
<p class=KRCC>Carol moved out today.
<sync start=156171>&nbsp;
<sync start=157212>
<p class=KRCC>-Let me get you some coffee. 
<sync start=159328>&nbsp;
<sync start=157212>
<p class=KRCC>Thanks.
<sync start=159328>&nbsp;
<sync start=163692>
<p class=KRCC>No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura.
<sync start=167526>&nbsp;
<sync start=168172>
<p class=KRCC>Just leave my aura alone, okay?
<sync start=170447>&nbsp;
<sync start=170692>
<p class=KRCC>Fine. Be murky.
<sync start=172922>&nbsp;
<sync start=173212>
<p class=KRCC>I'll be fine. I hope she'll be very happy.
<sync start=176284>&nbsp;
<sync start=176492>
<p class=KRCC>No, you don't.
<sync start=177447>&nbsp;
<sync start=177692>
<p class=KRCC>To hell with her. She left me!
<sync start=179728>&nbsp;
<sync start=180772>
<p class=KRCC>And you never knew she was a lesbian.
<sync start=183127>&nbsp;
<sync start=188812>
<p class=KRCC>Why does everyone keep fixating on that?
<sync start=191451>&nbsp;
<sync start=193012>
<p class=KRCC>She didn't know. How should I know?
<sync start=195526>&nbsp;
<sync start=197372>
<p class=KRCC>Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
<sync start=199932>&nbsp;
<sync start=201772>
<p class=KRCC>Did I say that out loud?
<sync start=203728>&nbsp;
<sync start=206212>
<p class=KRCC>I told Mom and Dad last night. They seemed to take it well.
<sync start=209522>&nbsp;
<sync start=209772>
<p class=KRCC>Really? So that hysterical call I got from a woman sobbing at 3 a.m. . .
<sync start=213970>&nbsp;
<sync start=214212>
<p class=KRCC>. . . ''I'll never have grandchildren! ''
<sync start=216442>&nbsp;
<sync start=216692>
<p class=KRCC>Was, what? A wrong number?
<sync start=218728>&nbsp;
<sync start=219412>
<p class=KRCC>Sorry.
<sync start=220731>&nbsp;
<sync start=221252>
<p class=KRCC>Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.
<sync start=224164>&nbsp;
<sync start=224412>
<p class=KRCC>You're angry. You're hurting.
<sync start=226721>&nbsp;
<sync start=226972>
<p class=KRCC>Can I tell you what the answer is?
<sync start=229122>&nbsp;
<sync start=229412>
<p class=KRCC>Strip joints!
<sync start=230606>&nbsp;
<sync start=232612>
<p class=KRCC>Come on, you're single. Have some hormones.
<sync start=235922>&nbsp;
<sync start=236172>
<p class=KRCC>See, but I don't want to be single, okay?
<sync start=238322>&nbsp;
<sync start=238532>
<p class=KRCC>I just want to be married again.
<sync start=241330>&nbsp;
<sync start=245852>
<p class=KRCC>And I just want a million dollars!
<sync start=247843>&nbsp;
<sync start=252932>
<p class=KRCC>Rachel?
<sync start=253921>&nbsp;
<sync start=254172>
<p class=KRCC>Oh, God, Monica! Hi! Thank God!
<sync start=256561>&nbsp;
<sync start=256812>
<p class=KRCC>I went to your building and this guy with a hammer said. . .
<sync start=259724>&nbsp;
<sync start=259932>
<p class=KRCC>. . .that you might be here and you are.
<sync start=262207>&nbsp;
<sync start=262452>
<p class=KRCC>-Can I get you some coffee? 
<sync start=265524>&nbsp;
<sync start=262452>
<p class=KRCC>Decaf.
<sync start=265524>&nbsp;
<sync start=266532>
<p class=KRCC>Everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.
<sync start=269968>&nbsp;
<sync start=270172>
<p class=KRCC>This is everybody. Chandler and Phoebe. . .
<sync start=272732>&nbsp;
<sync start=272972>
<p class=KRCC>. . .and Joey. And remember my brother, Ross?
<sync start=275167>&nbsp;
<sync start=275412>
<p class=KRCC>Sure!
<sync start=276322>&nbsp;
<sync start=286012>
<p class=KRCC>You want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
<sync start=290130>&nbsp;
<sync start=291532>
<p class=KRCC>Oh, God! Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.
<sync start=296128>&nbsp;
<sync start=296372>
<p class=KRCC>I was in this room with all the presents. . .
<sync start=298840>&nbsp;
<sync start=299092>
<p class=KRCC>. . .and I was looking at this gravy boat.
<sync start=301128>&nbsp;
<sync start=301332>
<p class=KRCC>This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
<sync start=304722>&nbsp;
<sync start=304932>
<p class=KRCC>When all of a sudden I realize-- Sweet 'N Low?
<sync start=307321>&nbsp;
<sync start=307732>
<p class=KRCC>I realized. . .
<sync start=309848>&nbsp;
<sync start=310092>
<p class=KRCC>. . .I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry.
<sync start=313687>&nbsp;
<sync start=313892>
<p class=KRCC>And then I really freaked out, when it hit me:
<sync start=316565>&nbsp;
<sync start=316812>
<p class=KRCC>How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.
<sync start=319326>&nbsp;
<sync start=320172>
<p class=KRCC>I always knew he looked familiar, but. . . .
<sync start=322925>&nbsp;
<sync start=325692>
<p class=KRCC>I had to get out of there, and I started wondering. . .
<sync start=328923>&nbsp;
<sync start=329132>
<p class=KRCC>. . . ''Why am I doing this?'' and ''Who am I doing this for?''
<sync start=332602>&nbsp;
<sync start=332852>
<p class=KRCC>I didn't know where to go, and I know you and I have drifted apart. . .
<sync start=337050>&nbsp;
<sync start=337292>
<p class=KRCC>. . .but you're the only person I know in the city.
<sync start=339931>&nbsp;
<sync start=340132>
<p class=KRCC>Who wasn't asked to the wedding.
<sync start=341770>&nbsp;
<sync start=342092>
<p class=KRCC>I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.
<sync start=344925>&nbsp;
<sync start=360172>
<p class=KRCC>I guess he bought her the pipe organ. . .
<sync start=362242>&nbsp;
<sync start=362492>
<p class=KRCC>. . .and she's really not happy about it.
<sync start=364926>&nbsp;
<sync start=366412>
<p class=KRCC>''Tuna or egg salad?''
<sync start=367481>&nbsp;
<sync start=367732>
<p class=KRCC>''Decide! ''
<sync start=368847>&nbsp;
<sync start=370492>
<p class=KRCC>''I'll have whatever Christine is having. ''
<sync start=373723>&nbsp;
<sync start=375132>
<p class=KRCC>Daddy, I just-- I can't marry him.
<sync start=378169>&nbsp;
<sync start=378692>
<p class=KRCC>I'm sorry.
<sync start=380171>&nbsp;
<sync start=380412>
<p class=KRCC>I just don't love him.
<sync start=382926>&nbsp;
<sync start=383612>
<p class=KRCC>Well, it matters to me!
<sync start=385682>&nbsp;
<sync start=389252>
<p class=KRCC>''If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off. ''
<sync start=393325>&nbsp;
<sync start=394772>
<p class=KRCC>She should not be wearing those pants.
<sync start=397445>&nbsp;
<sync start=398772>
<p class=KRCC>I say push her down the stairs!
<sync start=400763>&nbsp;
<sync start=401012>
<p class=KRCC>Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
<sync start=403606>&nbsp;
<sync start=407692>
<p class=KRCC>Come on, Daddy, listen!
<sync start=409444>&nbsp;
<sync start=410892>
<p class=KRCC>All my life, everyone's always told me, ''You're a shoe! ''
<sync start=414487>&nbsp;
<sync start=415132>
<p class=KRCC>''You're a shoe! You're a shoe! You're a shoe! ''
<sync start=417407>&nbsp;
<sync start=417652>
<p class=KRCC>I stopped and said, ''What if I don't wanna be a shoe?
<sync start=420564>&nbsp;
<sync start=420812>
<p class=KRCC>What if I want to be a purse?
<sync start=424248>&nbsp;
<sync start=424452>
<p class=KRCC>Or a hat?''
<sync start=425726>&nbsp;
<sync start=426732>
<p class=KRCC>I don't want you to buy me a hat, I--
<sync start=429041>&nbsp;
<sync start=429292>
<p class=KRCC>It's a metaphor, Daddy!
<sync start=431328>&nbsp;
<sync start=433012>
<p class=KRCC>You can see where he'd have trouble.
<sync start=435321>&nbsp;
<sync start=437932>
<p class=KRCC>Look, Daddy, it's my life.
<sync start=439763>&nbsp;
<sync start=441412>
<p class=KRCC>Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
<sync start=444324>&nbsp;
<sync start=446372>
<p class=KRCC>I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.
<sync start=449330>&nbsp;
<sync start=450292>
<p class=KRCC>Well, maybe that's my decision.
<sync start=452522>&nbsp;
<sync start=453612>
<p class=KRCC>Well, maybe I don't need your money.
<sync start=455728>&nbsp;
<sync start=455932>
<p class=KRCC>Wait! Wait! I said maybe!
<sync start=457729>&nbsp;
<sync start=465892>
<p class=KRCC>Just breathe. Breathe, that's it.
<sync start=468565>&nbsp;
<sync start=468812>
<p class=KRCC>Just try to think of nice, calm things.
<sync start=471121>&nbsp;
<sync start=471572>
<p class=KRCC>Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens
<sync start=475042>&nbsp;
<sync start=475292>
<p class=KRCC>Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens
<sync start=479205>&nbsp;
<sync start=479972>
<p class=KRCC>La la la something And noodles with string
<sync start=483362>&nbsp;
<sync start=483612>
<p class=KRCC>-These are a-- 
<sync start=485728>&nbsp;
<sync start=483612>
<p class=KRCC>I'm all better now.
<sync start=485728>&nbsp;
<sync start=487612>
<p class=KRCC>I helped.
<sync start=489125>&nbsp;
<sync start=491172>
<p class=KRCC>This is probably for the best, you know?
<sync start=493447>&nbsp;
<sync start=494292>
<p class=KRCC>Independence. Taking control of your life.
<sync start=496852>&nbsp;
<sync start=497092>
<p class=KRCC>The whole ''hat'' thing.
<sync start=498650>&nbsp;
<sync start=498892>
<p class=KRCC>If you need anything, you can always come to Joey.
<sync start=503044>&nbsp;
<sync start=503292>
<p class=KRCC>Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
<sync start=506443>&nbsp;
<sync start=508292>
<p class=KRCC>Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day.
<sync start=510726>&nbsp;
<sync start=510972>
<p class=KRCC>What? Like there's a rule or something?
<sync start=513532>&nbsp;
<sync start=516212>
<p class=KRCC>I got it.
<sync start=517327>&nbsp;
<sync start=518692>
<p class=KRCC>Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound.
<sync start=521923>&nbsp;
<sync start=522172>
<p class=KRCC>It's Paul.
<sync start=523730>&nbsp;
<sync start=523972>
<p class=KRCC>Oh, God. Is it 6:30? Buzz him in.
<sync start=527248>&nbsp;
<sync start=527492>
<p class=KRCC>-Who's Paul? 
<sync start=529926>&nbsp;
<sync start=527492>
<p class=KRCC>Paul, the wine guy?
<sync start=529926>&nbsp;
<sync start=530132>
<p class=KRCC>Maybe.
<sync start=530928>&nbsp;
<sync start=531172>
<p class=KRCC>Your ''not a real date,'' is with Paul, the wine guy?
<sync start=534289>&nbsp;
<sync start=534532>
<p class=KRCC>He finally asked you out?
<sync start=536409>&nbsp;
